**Web Scraping Rental House Data from Makaan using Selenium
Overview**
This project involves web scraping rental house data from the Makaan website using Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browser interaction. The scraped data serves as the foundation for further analysis and predictive modeling of rental prices in the real estate market.

**Motivation**
Accurately estimating rental prices is essential for both tenants and landlords in the real estate market. Traditional methods often lack comprehensiveness and may not capture the full range of factors influencing rental prices. Web scraping provides a solution to gather comprehensive data, enabling a more accurate and data-driven approach to rental price estimation.

**Methodology**

**1. Selenium Web Scraping**
Utilized Selenium to automate web browser interactions and extract rental house data from the Makaan website.
Configured the scraper to navigate through pages, apply filters (e.g., location, budget range, property type), and extract relevant information such as property details, amenities, and pricing.
**2. Data Extraction and Storage**
1)Extracted data including property location, size, amenities, and rental prices from the web pages.
2)Stored the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV file) for further processing and analysis.

**Usage**
Configure the scraping parameters such as location, budget range, and property type in the scraper script (makaan_scraper.py).
Run the scraper script to initiate the web scraping process.
The script will automate the browsing process, extract rental house data based on the specified parameters, and save the data to a designated file.

**Results**
Successfully scraped rental house data from the Makaan website, including a wide range of features and rental prices.
The scraped data serves as valuable input for further analysis and modeling to predict rental prices accurately.

**Future Enhancements**
Implement error handling and robustness improvements to handle various scenarios encountered during web scraping.
Explore additional websites or sources for gathering rental house data to enhance the dataset's diversity and coverage.
Incorporate advanced techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing to improve the quality of the scraped data.
